The list can store any number of values or objects dynamically and it maintains the order of them,
The set on the other hand does not allow duplicates.

We can use a set to store any number of values again dynamically and these two have a lot of methods
to deal with how to add elements how to remove elements etc.

Dictionary is a map that is dictionary can be used to store key and value pairs and it has a separate set of methods to deal with keys and values.
So we're going to work with lists, set's, dictionaries and more in this section.
