One last and important piece of slicing is passing a step value which is the third value that we can
pass to slice.

When we do slicing print s of zero colon and nine colon we can pass a step value which could be any number say 2 by default the step value is one that is if we go from one value to the other or one character
to the other character in the string but if I give steps off to let's run the program and see the output it will do the alternate characters here.

So it will jump two at that time,It starts with why then it goes to you.
It dumps the space goes to a jumps r goes to the e jumps the space goes to a and that is what you see in the output.

You can also change this two steps of three if you want.You can also use negative values starting from the end so s off,
I want to start from 15 all the way at the end.

I'm not giving any starting value minus 1 so it will come from the end all the way to the beginning,
Because I'm using a minus one.So it's in reverse order.

run it and it will reverse our string,If you notice it it is emosewa era uoY another easy way instead of specifying this or the length of the string.
We can omit it to reverse a string using slicing.

We can simply use s off colon colon minus one that will automatically reverse the string because we are using a negative value it knows that it has to decrement it and it has to do that by starting
at the end of the string all the way to the beginning.

Run it and that will reverse the string as well. So in this lecture we have learned how to use a step which is very powerful.
