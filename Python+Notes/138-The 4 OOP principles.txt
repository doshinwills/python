In this lecture you will learn what the four key object oriented principles are,They are number one encapsulation inheritance abstraction and Polymorphism.

These four principles are not only present in Python but they are common across any object oriented programming language like Java, C++ etc. and we implement these four features using classes and objects
which we will explore in the next few lectures and sections.
