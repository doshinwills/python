Process allow us to create our own data types that is user defined data types.They act as a blueprint for our objects just like how we have blueprints when we build houses.

We have the architects provide us with the blueprint and once we have a blueprint we can create any number of similar houses or we can build any number of similar houses.

Similarly in the old of object oriented programming a class represents a blueprint where all the fields
and methods for a particular object are defined.

Once we do that using that class we can create any number of objects which will have the same type of variables and methods.
For example here we are defining a class called product with three fields on it.

Now we can create any number of objects of this class as we want.In our application which will have all the three properties but with different values.

And if we define any functionality here like display product details etc. those functionality or methods will be available for all these objects as well.

So a class simply is a blueprint for creating multiple objects it defines all the rules that an object can carry.

That those rules are nothing but the variables or the fields and the methods on that class and object.Once we define a class you can create any number of objects using that class as you will see in the next
few lectures.
