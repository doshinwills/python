In this and the next few lectures, we will learn what a tupple is and how to use that tupple data structure
at tupple  is just like a list data structure, except for it is immutable meaning once we create a tupple of elements, we cannot modify the tupple.

So we use the tupple when we have a requirement in our application where we want a read-only list, a
list that should dot be modified by our program once it is created a.

tupple maintains the insertion order and we create a tupple , within which are we other elements that
will be the order that will be retained if it allows duplicate elements.

And we can also add different types of elements.That is heterogenous elements.

We can add integer strings, objects, everything to a tupple,We create a tupple using parentheses and the elements will be separated by commas.
The brackets are the parentheses are optional, but it is recommended that we use it as it is much more

readable, and if we have a tupple with just a single element, we should always end it with az comma,Otherwise, it will not be treated as a tupple.
It will be treated as a single element variable.

So remember, tupple is immutable,Once we create a tupple, we cannot do any changes to the elements in the tupple.
